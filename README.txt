Project implementing a subset of the standard old-school game Pacman. The game is implemented in C++ using the Qt framework.
The goal of the game is to avoid ghosts, pickup the map's key and open the lock, leading to the victory.
Heart icon in the top left corner represents the number of lives left. The game is over when the player loses all of his lives and touches a ghost.
The game is also over when the player wins the game by opening the lock with the key.
The player can move using the WADZ keys or by clicking on the desired location on the map.

The game can be restarted, quit and resumed by clicking on the desired button in the Pause menu accessed by pressing ESC.

Pacman does not move only on block edges, but also in the middle of the block. This is to make the game more enjoyable and easier to play.

The game is built utilizing CMake. The following commands are available in the root directory of the project:
- make run (to build and run the game)
- make clean (to clean the build, doc directories and the executable)
- make doxygen (to generate documentation)
- make pack (to generate a .zip archive of the project)
- make (to build the game)
